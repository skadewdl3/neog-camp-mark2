# Dr Who Quiz App

I made this CLI quiz app in neog camp level zero. I made use of readline-sync for taking input and chalk for fancy shell text.

- One can type in option number to answer the question
- One can replay quiz at the end to try for a higher score
- Once quiz has ended, one can see their position in the leaderboard
